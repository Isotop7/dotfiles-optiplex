# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles. I'm using `openbox` and `polybar` for my device.

## Install instructions

Copy the files and folders to their corresponding locations:

`.Xdefaults` -> `~/.Xdefaults`
`.vimrc` -> `~/.vimrc`
`.zshrc` -> `~/.zshrc`
`.config` -> `~/.config`

## TODO

[ ] - Include VS Code theme
[ ] - Use rsync or another tool for updating and organizing dotfiles
