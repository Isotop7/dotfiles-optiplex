# dotfiles

This repo contains my dotfiles. I'm using `openbox` and `polybar` for my device.

WARNING: Right now setting icons in openbox is not working for me. This needs some further debugging (ref issue #4).

## Install instructions

Copy the files and folders to their corresponding locations:

- `.Xdefaults` -> `~/.Xdefaults`
- `.vimrc` -> `~/.vimrc`
- `.zshrc` -> `~/.zshrc`
- `.config` -> `~/.config`
